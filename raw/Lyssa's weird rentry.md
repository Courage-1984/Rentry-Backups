# Lyssa's weird rentry

!!! note Please read
These are just my opinions and you're free to disagree. I am not saying any of the things listed are objectively better than whatever you're using right now (there are exceptions lmao). I might dump some of my other shit in here or such so please do not mind the random garbage littered around.

### Miscelanneous other rentries i've made:

### Discord Client:

[Vesktop (Windows, Mac, Linux)](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/releases/latest)
A great Discord client modification with Vencord integrated and ready to go, based on web discord so it is faster than the normal Discord app.

[Aliucord (Android)](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord/releases/latest)
Discord client for mobile based on the old Discord app. Doesn't need root, great plugin system, isn't janky like the new Discord versions.

[Vendetta (Android & iOS)](https://github.com/vendetta-mod/Vendetta) NOW DEAD! still works tho
Great Discord client also for mobile that is based on the newest versions of the Discord app. Doesn't need root, has a cool plugin system and is generally more feature-full but is incredibly janky sometimes more or less because of new Discord being shit in general.

### Browser

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all)
Browser I install on basically almost every device I own. It isn't chromium, that's all you need to know.

[Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/en/download/browser/windows)
Great browser for people concerned about their privacy and safety on the interwebz. Partnered with the Tor project.

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
Based on Chromium. It works. Shit browser riddled with Google annoyances but remains an optimal choice for most users anyways.

### Operating System

[Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021](https://drive.massgrave.dev/en-us_windows_10_iot_enterprise_ltsc_2021_x64_dvd_257ad90f.iso)
OS that I use as my daily drive. Fast, bloat-free, no compatibility issues with almost anything, no advertising. No WIndows 11 version available at the moment. Telemetry is very easy to disable.

[Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2019](https://drive.massgrave.dev/en_windows_10_iot_enterprise_ltsc_2019_x64_dvd_a1aa819f.iso)
Basically the same concept as above, just an older Windows 10 version. Specifically 1809. It's useful for old hardware which doesn't need the latest and greatest.

## Piracy

[MAS](https://massgrave.dev/index.html#Method_1_-_PowerShell)
Tool that can permanently activate almost any Windows and Office version including Subscription based products. Can also change Windows edition.

[IAS](https://massgrave.dev/idm-activation-script.html#Method_1_-_PowerShell)
Internet Download Manager activation script. Pretty self-explanatory.

[movie-web](https://movie-web.app)
Hands down the best website for streaming movies or series for free. Most movies have tons of subtitles.

[SteamRIP](https://steamrip.com)
Cracked games from Steam. Pretty high quality and fast downloading speeds.
[FitGirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site)
High quality repacks of large games. Compression is usually very good and is a godsend for users with subpar internet speeds.
